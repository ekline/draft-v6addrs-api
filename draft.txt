                      IPv6 Multiple Addresses API
                    draft-kline-6man-v6addrs-api-00

Abstract

   RFC 7934 [RFC7934] recommends that general-purpose hosts be given
   multiple addresses for current and future application needs.  This
   document describes the requirements for an API by which applications
   can request multiple addresses and the requirements for host
   operating systems supporting such an API.

1.  Introduction

   RFC 7934 [RFC7934] recommends that general-purpose hosts be given
   multiple addresses for current and future application needs.  This
   document describes the requirements for an API by which applications
   can request multiple addresses and the requirements for host
   operating systems supporting such an API.

   XXX: expound a bit more?

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Motivating Use Cases

2.1.  Ephemeral Addresses

   Applications may want to obtain an address for some ephemeral use
   case.  These may be desirable for privacy purposes, injecting some
   measure of randomness into communications, or for tracking
   application activity on a per-application basis.  One hypothetical
   example might be a DNS recursive resolver that spreads queries across
   multiple addresses in order to increase its resistance to cache-

   poisoning attacks in situations where DNS cookies [RFC7873] may not
   be reliably available.

   In these cases, specific port reservations are not required.  This
   may be because some explicit bind() will take place upon notification
   of the availability of a new address, or because a listening socket
   is bound to a wildcard address and the operating system is expected
   to deliver traffic at the listening port on the new address to the
   application.

   XXX: the cleanup from this, where other applications may have used an
   address and it cannot easily be freed may indicate that this use case
   is not really worth the effort.  Alternatively, there might be some
   policy limiting the number of simultaneous "shared" addresses.

2.2.  Exclusive-use Addresses

   Some applications may need "exclusive-use addresses".  In these use
   cases, the application wants to control both all traffic originating
   from and received at this address.  Such traffic may be originated
   and received by the application itself, e.g. a 464xlat CLAT daemon.
   Alternatively, the application may wish to delegate the flow of
   traffic to another application, likely in coordination with other
   operating system functions, e.g. an application controlling a virtual
   machine (VM) for which it is attempting to arrange minimal IPv6
   network connectivity.

3.  API Requirements

   IPv6 addressing can change dynamically in response to changes in the
   network (i.e. due to events other than administrative action on the
   host itself).  If IPv6 optimistic addresses ([RFC4429]) are used, an
   address might fail Duplicate Address Detection and need to be
   withdrawn from use.  Similarly, IPv6 prefixes from which addresses
   are formed might become deprecated via Router Advertisements (and may
   also transition from deprecated back to valid) or they may expire
   when a delegated prefix expires (e.g. without a successful DHCPv6
   renewal).

   Similarly, multiple IPv6 prefixes may be available for creating
   addresses via this API.  There may also be multiple network
   interfaces with advertised prefixes from which an address might be
   formed.

   It is therefore a meta-requirement for this API that these
   complexities MUST be explicitly supported.  Failure to do so would
   mean the spread of inflexible APIs yielding brittle applications,
   unable to adapt sensibly to changing network conditions.

Internet-Draft               IPv6 Addrs API                November 2017


3.1.  Request

   An API implementation MUST include a method by which an application
   can request an address ("ADDR_REQUEST").

   TODO: possible arguments? address type, timeout, callback function,
   interface?  Should it be possible to request a specific prefix, or a
   specific IID on all available prefixes?

   The return type of the ADDR_REQUEST method must be either an error,
   if an error can be quickly known (e.g. invalid arguments,
   insufficient permissions, et cetera) or a token suitable for use in
   other API calls.

3.2.  Release

   An API implementation MUST include a method by which an application
   can release a previously allocated address ("ADDR_RELEASE").  This
   method SHOULD take as input the non-error return value from the
   ADDR_REQUEST method.

3.3.  Asynchronous Notification

   TODO: discussion of requirements for async notifications; callbacks?
   signals? (shudder) callback_mechanism

   o  MUST notify applications when an address request has been
      satisfied (if it was not synchronously satisfiable at ADDR_REQUEST
      time).

   o  MUST notify applications when an address is deprecated, when DAD
      fails (if optimistic addrs are in use), ... any other time the
      address becomes unusable.

   o  Similarly, MUST notify applications when an address that has not
      been released via ADDR_RELEASE becomes usable after a prior
      unusable notification (e.g. when "un-deprecated" if the prefix
      lifetime is renewed).

4.  Requirements for Supporting Operating Systems

   Supporting host operating systems MUST support an asynchronous API.
   The dynamic nature of IPv6 means, among other things, that the prefix
   from which an address was formed might become deprecated at any time
   (and similarly could theoretically transition from deprecated back to
   valid).  Applications MUST be able to receive notifications of such
   changes.

   The callback and asynchronous notification mechanisms SHOULD work
   well with the operating systems' popular asynchronous event loop
   APIs.

   At process exit: release and remove all exclusive-use addresses and
   mark shared-use addresses as deprecated (unless they have been
   explicitly handed out to another application via this API).

   Shared-use addresses may be reused (given back to application in
   response to another request) if no new addresses may be formed.
   Alternatively, an error condition may be signaled.

   An operating system MAY satisfy ADDR_REQUEST calls with optimistic
   addresses.  If this is supported, notifications of the failure of
   this address to become validated (DAD) MUST be delivered to the
   application.

   An operating system MAY perform additional "usability" checks on an
   address (beyond just DAD) when asynchronously satisfying an
   ADDR_REQUEST call.  This might include, for example, verifying
   Neighbor Unreachability Detection from this address to on-link
   routers completes successfully.  The operating system might even
   perform a captive portal connectivity check from this address.

5.  Open Issues

   This section will be replaced by a summary of discussion of issues
   rejected here.  Decisions adopted will necessarily be incorporated
   elsewhere in this document.

   Should all requests be exclusive, even if not required?  This is
   likely to be simpler to implement and manage.  Might make it harder
   to share address use among multiple apps if that were desired.

   How to specify requests when multiple prefixes could theoretically be
   used to satisfy the request?  Avoid giving the same IID on multiple
   prefixes, for sure.  But otherwise?

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
